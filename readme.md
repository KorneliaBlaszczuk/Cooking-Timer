## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KorneliaBlaszczuk/Cooking-Timer
   ```
2. **Set up Firebase**:
   - Create your own Firebase project by visiting [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - After creating a project, navigate to the **Firestore Database** section and set it up to store dish data.
   - Generate your Firebase configuration credentials by going to your project settings.
   - Copy your Firebase config credentials and add them to your project. You can do this by adding your Firebase configuration in `src/firebaseConfig.js`.

   Example of how to set up Firebase configuration in `src/firebaseConfig.js`:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
   };

   // Initialize Firebase
   firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   ```
3. Install Dependencies
    - Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
    - Navigate to the project folder and install required dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Run the Backend
    - In the /src folder, start the server by running the following command:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
5. Open the App
    After the server is running, open the index.html file in your browser to start using the app.
